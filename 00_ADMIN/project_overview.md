# Project Overview — XAI-TrustFramework

## Title
**Operationalizing Multidimensional Trust in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**  
*Developing measurable, reproducible, and governance-aligned trust metrics for Responsible AI Systems.*

---

## Summary

The **XAI-TrustFramework** project aims to design and validate a **multidimensional framework** for evaluating *trust* in explainable AI (XAI) systems.  
Rather than assessing predictive accuracy, the framework focuses on the **reliability, transparency, and interpretability of explanations** produced by different XAI techniques under realistic conditions.

The project bridges the gap between **theoretical guarantees** of XAI methods (e.g., *local accuracy*, *consistency*, *proximity*) and their **empirical behavior** across user roles and application contexts.  
It provides a systematic way to measure **how, when, and for whom** explanations are trustworthy.

## Core Research Question

> **To what extent do explainable AI techniques preserve their theoretically guaranteed properties of trust—such as fidelity, stability, completeness, and actionability—when applied to real predictive models, and how does this validity vary across data types, user roles, and trust dimensions?**

---

## Conceptual Foundation

The framework builds on the notion that **trust in AI is multidimensional**, and that each dimension can be operationalized through measurable notions and metrics.

| Dimension | Description | Example Notions | Primary Roles |
|------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Technical** | Reliability, stability, and internal consistency of explanations. | Fidelity, Completeness, Stability | Engineer, Auditor |
| **Cognitive** | Interpretability and understandability for human decision-makers. | Comprehensibility, Precision, Coverage | Clinician, Analyst |
| **Institutional** | Traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with governance standards. | Auditability, Transparency | Regulator, Policy Maker |
| **Social** | Fairness, actionability, and human empowerment in decision-making. | Actionability, Contestability, Plausibility | Patient, End-user |

These dimensions align with the European AI ethics and governance principles (AI Act, GDPR, CSRD) and provide a structure for empirical validation.

## Methodological Architecture

The project operationalizes trust through a consistent analytical logic:

> **[Data Type] → [Task Type] → [Base Model] → [XAI Technique] → [Trust Notions / Metrics] → [Formulas / Implementation]**

This approach ensures that every experimental setup can be traced from data and model characteristics to measurable outcomes of trust.

## Experimental Pilots

Three primary pilots and one supplementary scenario validate the framework’s scalability across data types and learning paradigms:

| Pilot | Domain | Task Type | Base Model | XAI Technique | Evaluated Trust Notions | Core Metrics | Trust Dimensions |
|--------|----------|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **A** | Tabular (clinical) | Regression | RandomForestRegressor | **TreeSHAP** | Fidelity, Completeness, Stability | Fidelity score, Additive residual, Correlation (ρ) | Technical |
| **B** | Tabular (business/financial)** | Classification | XGBoostClassifier | **Anchors** | Local Fidelity, Precision, Coverage | Precision, Coverage, Local fidelity error | Cognitive |
| **C** | Image (biomedical/industrial)** | Classification | ResNet50 | **Grad-CAM** | Spatial Fidelity, Saliency Consistency | IoU, SSIM, Saliency correlation | Technical + Social |
| **(Supplementary)** | Any domain | Regression/Classification | Any model | **DiCE** | Actionability, Diversity, Feasibility | Distance(x,x′), Diversity index | Social |

Together, these pilots demonstrate how trust metrics can be generalized across **data modalities (tabular, visual)** and **reasoning paradigms (attributive, counterfactual, symbolic, perceptual)**.

## Techniques and Theoretical Guarantees

Each selected technique contributes distinct theoretical guarantees that can be empirically validated within the framework:

| Technique | Paradigm | Key Properties | Main Trust Notions | Metrics | Dimension |
|------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|----------|------------|
| **SHAP (TreeSHAP)** | Attributive | Local accuracy, Consistency, Missingness | Fidelity, Completeness, Stability | Additive residual, Correlation (ρ) | Technical |
| **DiCE** | Counterfactual | Proximity, Feasibility, Diversity | Actionability, Diversity, Plausibility | Distance(x,x′), Feasibility ratio | Social |
| **Anchors** | Rule-based | High-precision locality | Local Fidelity, Precision, Coverage | Rule precision, Coverage ratio | Cognitive |
| **Grad-CAM** | Visual | Gradient–activation consistency | Spatial Fidelity, Saliency Consistency | IoU, SSIM | Technical + Social |
